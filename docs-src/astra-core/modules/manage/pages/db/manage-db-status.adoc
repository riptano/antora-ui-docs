= Database statuses

Your database can exist in a range of statuses. These statuses vary based on the actions you take within your database.

To see the system status of Astra, see https://status.astra.datastax.com/.

To see the status of a specific database, view your database *Dashboard*.

== All databases

=== Active
Your database is available and ready to use.

=== Initializing
You've made your database selections. It should be ready for you to use soon.

=== Terminating/Terminated
You have terminated your database, which means your database and all data on your database will be removed. Your database is no longer available.

=== Error
Something is wrong with your database. Contact {support_url}[DataStax Support, window="_blank"].

=== Maintenance
When a database is moving into hibernated or restarting from hibernated, your database will display that it is in the *Maintenance* status.

=== Hibernated
When an {astra_db} database on the *Free* plan has been unused for more than 48 hours, it will automatically enter the *Hibernated* status.  

[NOTE]
====
It may take a few minutes for your hibernated {astra_db} database to resume (return to *Active* status). 
====

[TIP]
====
Database hibernation only occurs on the *Free* plan. *Hibernated* does not occur on the {astra_db} paid plans. To avoid *Hibernated*, and to take full advantage of additional {astra_db} functionality, upgrade from the *Free* plan to a *Pay As You Go* plan, or to an *Enterprise* plan. For details, see link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/pricing-and-billing.html[Pricing and billing] and the {astra_db} link:https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra/pricing[pricing calculators].
