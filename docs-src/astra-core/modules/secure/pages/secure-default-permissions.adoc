= Default {astra_db} user permissions
:slug: default-user-permissions
:page-tag: security,astra-db,permissions

When creating an {company} {astra_db} database, the default user is created with the required permissions to manage the created keyspace.
This default user is not equivalent to the `cassandra` superuser.
However, the default user is granted the following permissions in the keyspace created on the database:

* Create, select, modify, drop, and describe database objects, including keyspaces, tables, and roles
* Grant the same or lesser permissions to additional user roles
* Create and drop additional user roles

[NOTE]
====
You must be the default user to create additional users within the selected keyspace.
