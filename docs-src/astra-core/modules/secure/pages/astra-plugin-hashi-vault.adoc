== Astra DB Plugin for HashiCorp Vault
:page-tag: security,astra-db,plugins,hashi-vault

{company} {astra_db} Plugin for HashiCorp Vault is an open-source project that adds robust token lifecycle management features for {astra_db}. Due to the nature of the {astra_db} object hierarchy, by default, API tokens are not associated with specific users and currently the tokens do not have metadata descriptions. 

For more details, see the full https://github.com/datastax/vault-plugin-secrets-datastax-astra/blob/main/docs/index.md[Astra DB Plugin for HashiCorp Vault documentation, window="_blank"] in the plugin's open-source GitHub repo.  

Without the plugin, it's easy to lose track of:

* Who created tokens
* The purpose of each token
* Which tokens are being used actively 

Consequently, there's no audit trail of who has downloaded and used tokens, and there's no tracking regarding who may have manually shared tokens with others. 

{astra_db} Plugin for HashiCorp Vault solves these security management issues. To ensure that your token ownership and usage are well understood, the plugin gives you the ability to associate metadata with tokensâ€”such as the user who created each token, and what it is being used for. The plugin also logs who has accessed the tokens.
