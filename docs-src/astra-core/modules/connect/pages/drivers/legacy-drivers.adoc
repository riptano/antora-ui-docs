If the driver you are using doesnâ€™t support the {company} {astra_db} secure connect bundle and you are unable to upgrade, you can still connect to {astra_db} with additional steps. To connect, collect connection information from the secure connect bundle and set up the required SSL context for your driver to speak with {astra_db}.

== Prerequisites

== Collect {astra_db} connection information

. From the secure connect bundle, collect the SSL related files:

* ca.cert
* cert
* key

. From the `cqlshrc` file, collect the port.
[IMPORTANT]

Use only the port from `cqlshrc`.
Other ports found in the secure connect bundle will not allow you to connect with this method.
