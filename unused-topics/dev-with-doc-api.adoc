= Developing with the {astra_db} Document API
:keywords: database, document, api

{company} {astra_db} uses the Stargate Document API to modify and query data stored as
unstructured JSON documents in collections.
Because the Document API uses schemaless data, no data modeling is required!

The blog https://stargate.io/2020/10/19/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api.html[The Stargate Cassandra Documents API, window="_blank"] describes the underlying structure used to store collections.

== Information about namespaces and collections.

To use the Document API, you must define the namespace that will store  collections.
Collections store unstructured JSON documents.
Documents can themselves hold multiple documents.
Multiple collections are contained in a namespace, but a collection cannot be
contained in multiple namespaces.

Only namespaces need to specifically created.
Collections are specified when a document is inserted.

// tag::swaggerUI[]
== Swagger UI for the Document API

You can access the Document API in a browser with Swagger UI at
`https://$ASTRA_CLUSTER_ID-$ASTRA_REGION.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/rest/swagger-ui/`.
Adding parameter information, you can generate `cURL` commands to execute and
display results that will return.
// end::swaggerUI[]

== Using Postman

If you prefer, you can use Postman as a client interface for exploring the Document API
(https://www.postman.com/downloads/[download here]).
We've provided a
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stargate/docs/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate_Document_API_users_Astra.postman_collection.json[Stargate Document API Postman Astra Collection]
that you can import in Postman to play with the examples shown in this walkthrough.

== Prerequisites

Before you get started, set your environment variables to save time developing
on your database.

. In link:https://astra.datastax.com[Astra, window="_blank"], select the database to which you want to connect.
. In your *Database Dashboard*, select *Connect*.
. Select *Document API*.
. Follow the steps in the prerequisites to get your xref:manage:org/managing-org.adoc#_manage_application_tokens[application token] and set up your environment variables.
. In your command-line interface associated with your environment, paste the following environment variables copied for your Astra database:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
export ASTRA_DB_ID=<database_id>
export ASTRA_DB_REGION=<database_region>
export ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=<keyspace_name>
export ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=<app_token>
