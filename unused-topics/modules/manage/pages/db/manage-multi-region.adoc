= Using multiple regions

You can replicate data to multiple regions for high availability scenarios to ensure active-active applications failover models.
Multiple regions also ensure application data availability for locality purposes with the added value of cost savings.

Because multiple regions will increase your billing, see xref:manage:org/manage-billing.adoc[Pricing and billing] for more details.

=== Limitations
Lightweight transactions work for only a single-region datacenter.

If you original region is disconnected, schema changes are suspended and repairs do not run.
If any regions are disconnected, the writes to those regions will not be forwarded.

While adding a new region, you cannot drop a table or keyspace and you cannot truncate a table.

If any region is not online, you cannot truncate a table.
