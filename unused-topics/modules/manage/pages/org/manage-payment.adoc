You can also update your payment method in the Billing & Payments section. Your Billing & Payments will also display each database included in your server, allowing you to see what your total cost is per database.

Update the payment method you entered when xref:manage:db/managing-db.adoc#_create_your_astra_db_database[creating your {company} {astra_db} database].
Before your monthly credit runs out, you must enter your credit card number and associated billing information to ensure your database remains accessible.

Enter updated credit card information and associated billing details, or delete the existing payment method.

{astra_db} supports one payment method for each organization.

== Removing a Payment Method

Use this section to remove any payment method associated with {astra_db} serverless and https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-streaming/docs/[Astra Streaming].

There are two selections to consider before removing your payment method: any outstanding balance for your organization and any premium features added to this plan. A premium feature, such as multi-region or private endpoints, is optionally applied to a resource.

To remove your payment method, open your {astra_db} account and go to *Billing*. Your organizationâ€™s dashboard of billing services and payments made is available for viewing. Click *Remove*.

=== Prerequisites

Ensure your organization meets the following requirements to remove your payment method:

* With no outstanding balance and no premium features, you can remove your payment method at any time. A dialog box appears to confirm you want to remove the payment method; select *Remove Payment Method*.
