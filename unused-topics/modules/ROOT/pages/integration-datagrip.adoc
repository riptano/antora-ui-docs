= Connect DataGrip with {astra_db} using Simba JDBC Driver

You can connect your {company} {astra_db} to Datagrip using the Simba JDBC Driver for Apache Cassandra(R).
Follow these steps to set up the connection so you can run queries.

== Import IDE Settings

. Download the link:https://downloads.datastax.com/#odbc-jdbc-drivers[{company} JDBC Driver].
. Unzip the driver download.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, your file will be stored in your downloads directory. If you want to store your JDBC jar elsewhere, change the path under driver files to match the new file path.
====

. Download link:https://datastax-21b7c7df5342.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/232268459/929cbfa881f4423cceb8b3b2/settings.zip[settings.zip].
+
[CAUTION]
====
If you are already a DataGrip user, back up your existing settings because the download `settings.zip` might override your existing settings.
====

. Import the `settings.zip` into DataGrip by selecting *File* → *Manage IDE Settings* → *Import Settings* in DataGrip.
. From the directory menu, select the `settings.zip` file from the directory where it is stored.
. Select *Import and Restart*.
+
You will see a new database connection type called Astra:

. Go to the *Advanced Settings* to confirm the VM home path is set to `Default`.

== Establish the connection

When you create your connection, the URL will look like this:
`jdbc:cassandra://;AuthMech=<2>;UID=token;PWD=<ApplicationToken>;SecureConnectionBundlePath=<PATH TO YOUR SECURE CONNECT BUNDLE>;TunableConsistency=<6>`

image:ROOT:url.png[URL in the screenshot shows the format described in the previous sentence.]

* *AuthMech:* Specifies whether the driver connects to a Cassandra or {astra_db} database and whether the driver authenticates the connection.
* *ApplicationToken:* Generated from {astra_db} console. See xref:manage:org/managing-org.adoc#_manage_application_tokens[Manage application tokens].
* *SecureConnectionBundlePath:* Path to where your downloaded Secure Connect Bundle is located. See xref:connect:secure-connect-bundle.adoc[Get secure connect bundle].
* *TunableConsistency:* Specifies Cassandra replica or the number of Cassandra replicas that must process a query for the query to be considered successful.

== What's next?

Now that your connection is working, you can create tables, introspect your keyspaces, view your data in the DataGrip table explorer, and more.
