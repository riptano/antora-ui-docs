. In your command-line interface associated with your environment, paste the following environment variables copied for your {astra_db} database:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]

== Using Postman

If you prefer, you can use Postman as a client interface for exploring REST APIs
(https://www.postman.com/downloads/[download here]).
We've provided a
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stargate/docs/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate_REST_API_users_keyspace_Astra.postman_collection.json[Stargate REST API Postman Collection]
that you can import in Postman to play with the examples shown in this walkthrough.

Now you're ready to use the REST API for CRUD operations.
